Hi there, Iâ€™m Ingrid, a Principal Software Engineer passionate about building clean, scalable, and impactful solutions.

I architect scalable systems, build clean APIs, and obsess over making dev workflows smoother than a Friday deploy.
- Tech I enjoy working with: TypeScript, Python, Node.js, Golang, AWS, Terraform and Github workflows
- Passionate about: automating the boring stuff, improving DX, mentoring with empathy
- Not afraid to refactor until the code feels âœ¨rightâœ¨

When Iâ€™m not writing code, Iâ€™m probably planning a hike, cooking or experimenting with new productivity hacks.
